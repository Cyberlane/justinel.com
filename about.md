I'm Justin, a 32 year old software engineer living in Malm√∂, Sweden.

Over the years I have written code for a lot of different industries around the world. On top of
code, I have also designed and sold educational electronic kits at multiple Maker Faires and
Tech Conferences.

On this website I plan to share links to projects I have made, tutorial videos along with small
blog posts with useful code snippets I either discovered from others or came up with myself.
